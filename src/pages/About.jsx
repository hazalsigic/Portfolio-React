            <p>My journey has been quite an adventureâ€”beginning with political science,
               progressing into intelligence and security for my master's,
                and unexpectedly leading me to manage a dog sitting business alongside an online pet accessories store.
                But the plot thickens: I've recently embarked on a new path into the realm of front-end development through a bootcamp.
                Learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, testing, and React has been a thrilling rollercoaster ride. 
                Weekends often turn into coding marathons. There's an undeniable rush in overcoming coding challenges that keeps me fully engaged.
